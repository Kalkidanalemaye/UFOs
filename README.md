# UFOs
## Background
Danaâ€™s goal is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. So, she essentially needs to build two things: the webpage that will allow users to view the data (HTML) and a dynamic table that will present it (JavaScript).

## Challenge
In this challenge, I created additional filters for the webpage. The advanced filtering capability will allow users to filter the data by multiple factors.

## Objectives
1. Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
2. Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
3. Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.

## Instruction

Filter Data using the following columns

a. Date
b. City
c. State
d. Country
e. Shape

#### The webpage I have redesigned users can achieve filtered data using 2 or more filters. In addition, the filters appear on top of the table as a header to enhance the view of the data.

The following screenshots of the website show the website as it is and once the filters are applied.

# UFOs
## Background
Danaâ€™s goal is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. So, she essentially needs to build two things: the webpage that will allow users to view the data (HTML) and a dynamic table that will present it (JavaScript).
Dana wants to storyboard her website to have an idea of what her readers will see when they view the final product.
